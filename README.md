Machine learning project to predict pricing and type of wines based on factors like country of origin, critic's reviews, variety and description

Steps:

1. Clean data (looking out for null values and outliers)
2. Classify certain text columns as numeric / one-hot encoding for country of origin
3. Test machine learning models to predict price
     e.g. logistic regression, NLP (COSINE similarity), classification
   Possible tests: which factor is the strongest influcence on price? How can we utilize text columns like description to predict type of wine or price?
5. Chart results where applicable
6. Additional visualizations: maps of training & test values per country/region
