Using Python, machine learning, sklearn, pandas, and plotly, our team is attempting to predict the zodiac signs of OK Cupid users.

Steps:

1. Preprocess Data:
     i. Clean data (looking out for null values)
    ii. Classify certain text columns as numeric / dummy encoding
2. Test several different machine learning models to predict zodiac signs based on several factors in the OK Cupid profiles
     e.g. logistic regression, PCA, multi-label classification, k-means, etc.
   Which factors are common amongst each sign?
3. Plot visualizations to summarize test and training data results
