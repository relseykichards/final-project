Using Python, machine learning, sklearn, pandas, and Tableau, our team is predicting wine type (red, white, other), price, and points and visualizing the data and results.

Steps:

1. Preprocess Data:
     i. Clean data (looking out for null values, outliers)
    ii. Classify certain text columns as numeric / dummy encoding (one-hot-encoding the top 10 provinces of origin, for example)
2. Test several different machine learning models to predict price, points, and/or wine type based on the available information on each wine
     e.g. linear regression, PCA, multi-label classification, neural networks, etc.
   Which factors are driving the price? Which factors are driving points? How can we predict wine type?
3. Plot visualizations to summarize test and training data results, create visualizations of total dataset
